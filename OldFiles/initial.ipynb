    "There are several different types of properties of objects in polymake. The first big distiction is between input properties, these are the ones that the user is supposed to use for inputing data with 'imperfections', like redundant rays, points that aren't vertices, etc., and computed properties. The user may specify any property, but if for example 'VERTICES' are given instead of 'POINTS', then polymake will assume that any redundancies have been eliminated."
